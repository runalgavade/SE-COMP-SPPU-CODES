# 📊 Data Structures and Algorithms Lab (DSAL) – Semester 4

This folder contains efficient implementations of data structures and algorithms as per the **DSAL lab curriculum**.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Sorting (Quick, Merge, Heap)
- Searching (Binary, Linear)
- Hashing (Chaining, Open Addressing)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim)
- Tree Traversals, Heap, Priority Queue

## ⚙️ Tools Required
- C++ Compiler (preferably with STL)
- IDE (Code::Blocks or Visual Studio Code)

## 📌 Tip
Focus on:
- Time complexity
- Dry run for understanding flow
- Rewriting without STL for better learning (optional)

⭐ *Great for placements and coding interviews too!*
