# 🧠 Microprocessor Lab (8086/80386 ALP) – Semester 4

This folder contains **Assembly Language Programs (ALP)** based on 8086/80386 architecture, typically using NASM or TASM.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Number System Conversions (HEX ⇄ BCD)
- Arithmetic Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- Looping and Jump Instructions
- Logical Operations
- String and Array Handling
- Addressing Modes (Direct, Indirect, Indexed)
- Interrupts and Procedures

## ⚙️ Tools Required
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- Ubuntu terminal or DOSBox (for older tools)
- `nasm -f elf64 filename.asm && ld -o output filename.o`

## 🧪 Sample Programs
- Find the largest/smallest number in an array
- Convert HEX to ASCII or vice versa
- Multiply two 16-bit numbers

⭐ *Commenting and dry-running each instruction is key to understanding assembly flow.*
